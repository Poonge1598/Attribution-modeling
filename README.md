# Attribution Modeling 
## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of attribution modeling using Python. 
The notebook primarily focuses on the implementation of Attribution modeling and especially,'Markov Chain Approach'.

## Project Highlights
- **Developed and Assessed Various Models**: Implementation and assessment of first-touch, last-touch, 
  and Markov chain attribution models using customer journey data.
- **Shapley Value Modeling**: Utilization of Shapley value modeling to reveal a 32% conversion drop 
  when removing 'mobile' and 'paid search' channels.
- **Markov Model Analysis**: Demonstration of the Markov model's superiority, capturing 25% more initial 
  conversions, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- Data Handling and Analysis: `pandas`, `numpy`
- Visualization: `matplotlib.pyplot`, `seaborn`, `networkx`
- Statistical Modeling: `ChannelAttribution`

## Usage
This notebook is ideal for data scientists and marketing analysts interested in understanding and 
applying attribution modeling techniques in Python. It offers both theoretical insights and practical code implementations.
